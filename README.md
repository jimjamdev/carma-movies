## Project

![wtf](https://c.tenor.com/FFr1O0TsBzsAAAAC/coffee.gif)

So I went a path of SCSS modules, and a bunch of custom components. No third party UI library. Obviously didn't get everything I wanted completed.

# SetUp
- Nextjs
- Typescript
- SASS
- Redux
- Victory Charts - No way I was going to get custom D3 done in an afteroon :)

# Time
- Day 1 - Base
- Day 2 - Redux and Data
- Day 3 - Design
- Day 4 - UI
- Day 5 - Finish up as much as I can

# ToDo
- Make a nice scrollable loader for reuse over all data content
- Make some components more generic i.e. ImageFader
- A unit test
- Make the charts looks nicer (YUK!)
- Finish MovieItem

 **I have another meeting now, so have to push complete**
